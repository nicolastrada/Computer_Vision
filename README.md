Exercises of Computer Vision. University Course

For one of this exercises we will use a DNN (Neural Network) for object-detection. 
YOLO v3 --> To execute the exercise '8_dnn.ipynb' you need to download the file with the weights of the already trained network (247 MB) from this address:
https://pjreddie.com/media/files/yolov3.weights.

The file should be saved in the "dnn" directory, where "yolov3.cfg" (network configuration) and "yolov3.txt" (class names of the objects it was trained on) are already installed.
